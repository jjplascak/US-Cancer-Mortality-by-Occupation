A population-based study of US cancer mortality rates by detailed occupation among working-age adults, 2020-2023

See 'acs_allsubpops.csv' for estimated population at risk (e.g., rate denominators) accounting for employment changes over time, by occupation, sex, year, and age.

See 'Tables_ACS_rev_aug.22.25.xlsx' for detailed tables of results including listing all cancer mortality rates by occupation, sex, and cancer site/type.
